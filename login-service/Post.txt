From Construction Technology to Full Stack Development - My Journey of Passion & Learning!

After completing my engineering degree in Construction Technology and Management, I decided to take a career break to follow my passion. I've always been fascinated by the world of technology, and I knew there was more I wanted to explore.

Recently, I found my calling in Full Stack Development. Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I discovered the Upgrad Knowledge Hut program, and it has been a game-changer for me. The program has given me the opportunity to dive headfirst into the world of software technologies, with the soft skill and aptitude development helped me to enhance my communication and problem solving abilities and I'm loving every moment of it.

Learning to code, building web applications, and understanding the intricacies of both front-end and back-end development has been an incredible experience. It's amazing how technology can transform ideas into reality, and I'm excited to be a part of this journey.

I'm grateful for the support of my friends and family who have cheered me on throughout this transition. And I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts here on LinkedIn.
